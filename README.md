### Heart Disease Predictor

**Introduction**

Through this project we determine whether a person can have a heart disease in future or not?

**Dataset**

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

**Content**

Attribute Information:

1.age
2.sex
3.chest pain type (4 values)
4.resting blood pressure
5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.maximum heart rate achieved
9.exercise induced angina
10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
